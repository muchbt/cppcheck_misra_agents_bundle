name: cppcheck-misra-fix
description: Process one cppcheck/MISRA chunk at a time, apply minimal safe fixes, record edit points, and verify touched files.

# Goal

Fix high-confidence cppcheck and MISRA findings from one chunk at a time.

# Rules

- Only process the current chunk
- Follow the chunk's `fix_strategy` and each issue's `strategy_action`
- In `conservative` mode, prefer local, high-confidence fixes only
- In `all_auto` mode, attempt every issue when a technically valid minimal edit is possible
- Keep edits minimal
- Do not infer code intent from comments
- For high-risk fixes, keep edits isolated and mark them for human review
- In `conservative` mode, mark high-risk MISRA/volatile/interrupt/register/RTE/MCAL findings as `needs_manual_review`
- Record every independent edit point with issue links
- Update runtime state files after finishing the chunk
- Prefer completing work inside the current workspace
- If one issue is blocked, record the blocker and continue with other safe issues in the same chunk
- Do not wait indefinitely for sandbox, tool, or environment side effects; write blockers into runtime state and result files
- Ask users only when explicit authorization is required and no safe workspace-only path exists

# Required outputs

- fixed issues
- skipped issues
- needs_manual_review
- high-risk fixed issues with risk_level, risk_reason, and review_required_after_fix=true
- touched files
- edit records
- verification results
